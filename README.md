Previously, we learned that users viewing our sites need to have the typefaces we choose installed on their computers. 

Otherwise, the browser will not display them. 

Besides the limited number of web-safe typefaces installed on a user's computer, we're also able to provide our own fonts by importing web fonts. 

Web fonts are special types of fonts that are optimized for screen display, and they're linked to our web pages from an external source, then activated when needed.
